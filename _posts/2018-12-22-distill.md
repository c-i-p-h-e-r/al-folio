Have you seen the movie “Ground Hog Day”. Amazing concept isn’t it? 

I guess we all have our own Ground Hog Days. Days when we woke up to things that are perhaps repeating themselves. The days when we are back to square one and have to start all over again. 

While as a researcher I have faced that more often than not. On the contrary, sometimes we feel that if only we could wake up to a day where we could relive the past, perhaps in a better way; most importantly avoiding those silly mistakes of the past that have played so much in shaping our future. 

In this blog I want to share with you all my experiences as a cryptographer or should I say crypto-lover. Stay tuned. Oops…msg encrypted…
