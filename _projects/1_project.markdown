### About the project: 

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has funded a
large-scale 5G testbed project to encourage Indian startups and the industry to take an
early lead in 5G. The goal of the project is to build a test bed that closely resembles a
real-world 5G deployment.The project will deliver an end-to- end 5G testbed comprising
of 5G BS and UE nodes that support enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), Ultra low
latency communication (URLLC) and massive MTC including NB IoT services. This
testbed could become a basis for many commercial deployments.

__Who is involved?

Top Indian institutes and startups such as IITK, IITD, IITM, IISc,
Sameer, and CEWiT are involved in this project. Many private companies are also a
part of this effort.

* What is our role?

My team at IIT Bhilai is working with BSTTM, IIT Delhi to handle certain secuirty aspects of the 5G.
We are primarily solving the following problems:
1. Implementation of various cryptographic algorithms for the purpose of use in passive RFID systems
2. System Security including secure boot
