#### Design and Deveopment of PKI based USB Token
The idea here is to indegenously develop and manufacture a secure USB token/dongle based on Public-Key Infrastucture (PKI). 
The scope of the project is to design and develop an enterprise one card solution based
on SCOSTA Smartcard operating system comprising of a suite of applications. The
solutions developed will be compliant to ISO 18000â€“6C and ISO7816 standards.

Smartcards offer a secure and convenient form-factor on which employees can carry
digital credentials for accessing facilities, buildings, computers and network resources.
This will provide the ability for an employee to carry both physical and logical access
credentials on a single card. Adding to the significance of smartcards, the same card can
also be used for employee identification, Biometric credentials and potentially a multitude
of other applications, Patient ID and records, library management, financial transactions
etc.

This project also aims to indigenously develop ASIC for the Smartcard Controller. The
SCOSTA OS will be then ported on to the Smartcard controller ASIC. Reader modules along
with the necessary firmware and drivers will also be developed. The indigenous Smartcard
solution will be tested for multiple applications

#### ECC Standardization for SCOSTA

In the course of project, the secure dongle will be upgraded to support Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) for PKI support. Also the Draft ECC standard for SCOSTA-PKI will be devloped and submitted to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).
